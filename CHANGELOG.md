## [1.4.0] — 10-10-2026

### Added
- **Multi-Tier Always-Free Postal Code Support** (`core/config.php`, `core/delivery-zones.php`, `frontend/enqueue.php`, `assets/js/wa_cart.js`, `assets/css/cart-drawer.css`):
  - Added `SWAC_ALWAYS_FREE_SHIPPING_POSTAL_CODES` configuration constant (defaults to `[]`).
  - Added helper function `swac_is_always_free_shipping_postal_code($code)` with `swac_always_free_shipping_postal_codes` filter.
  - Localized `always_free_shipping_codes` to both `window.swacZones` and `window.swacConfig` / `window.swacCommerce`.
  - Added client-side `isAlwaysFreePincode(pincode)` and made `computeCartTotals()` postal-code aware to automatically waive shipping (`shipping = 0`, `isAlwaysFree: true`).
  - Made `renderLoyaltyUI()` display a distinct green `.swac-loyalty-card--free-zone` badge ("🎉 Free Delivery Unlocked!") while bypassing shipping gap nudges.
  - Added real-time postal code `input` and `blur` event triggers to dynamically recalculate drawer totals and loyalty cards as the customer types.
- **Background Cron Cleanup Guard** (`core/catalog-lockdown.php`):
  - Added a persistent one-time option guard (`swac_cron_cleaned`) on `init` that unschedules and clears unused WooCommerce background cron events (`woocommerce_cleanup_sessions`, `woocommerce_cleanup_personal_data`, `woocommerce_cancel_unpaid_orders`, `woocommerce_tracker_send_event`) to eliminate needless PHP wakeups.
- **0-Dependency Automated Testing Suite & CommonJS Export Parity** (`package.json`, `tests/`, `assets/js/wa_cart.js`):
  - Created root `package.json` with native Node.js test script (`node --test tests/**/*.test.js && node tests/php/runner.js`).
  - Added Node runtime environment guards (`typeof window`, `typeof document`, `typeof localStorage`) inside `assets/js/wa_cart.js`.
  - Exported core calculation helpers via CommonJS (`module.exports = { computeCartTotals, evaluateDeliveryZone, isAlwaysFreePincode, ... }`).
  - Added unit test suites under `tests/unit/` covering cart math, shipping thresholds, delivery cutoff windows, and delimiter safety.
  - Added static PHP verification runner `tests/php/runner.js` enforcing text domain consistency, structural token balance, and immutable zero-session invariants.
- **AI Maintenance Operating Manual** (`AGENTS.md`):
  - Codified the zero-session Stateless WhatsApp Catalog mental model, immutable invariants, Indian date format standard (`DD-MM-YYYY`), and testing guidelines for AI coding agents.

### Fixed
- **Text Domain Standardization** (`frontend/archive/archive-loop.php`, `frontend/single/notices.php`, `frontend/single/product-meta.php`):
  - Replaced lingering `woocommerce` text domains with canonical `stateless-wa-commerce` domain for Out of Stock badges and labels.

## [1.3.2] — 05-10-2026

### Fixed
- **403 Intercept on `wc-admin` (Menu Capability Check)**: Hooked WooCommerce Admin routes (`page=wc-admin`) to `admin_page_access_denied` in addition to `admin_init`. WordPress core validates menu capabilities inside `wp-admin/includes/menu.php` and executes `wp_die(..., 403)` before `admin_init` is ever called; intercepting `admin_page_access_denied` catches the access denial before headers are closed and seamlessly redirects to the classic product editor (`post-new.php?post_type=product`).
- **Eliminated Frontend Dual-Cart Split Brain**: Removed `is_user_logged_in()` exemptions from frontend `/cart/`, `/checkout/`, and `/my-account/` redirects (`template_redirect`), `woocommerce_get_cart_url`, native AJAX add-to-cart suppression, `wc-add-to-cart`/`wc-cart-fragments` script dequeues, and `SWAC_Null_Session_Handler`. Prevents administrators from having phantom products accumulating in native WooCommerce PHP sessions while concurrently viewing the client-side WhatsApp `localStorage` drawer.
- **Visual Builder Preview Safe Guards**: Explicitly exempted visual page builder editors and previews (`?elementor-preview`, `?breakdance`, `is_customize_preview()`, and `is_admin()`) so template editing remains completely unhindered.
- **Admin Bar Dashicons**: Ensured Dashicons remain enqueued on the frontend for authenticated users so the WordPress admin toolbar icons render crisply.

### Added
- **Theme & Builder Compatibility Guide** (`README.md`): Added comprehensive documentation on drop-in compatibility with **Breakdance Builder**, **Elementor**, **Bricks**, and **Block Themes**, detailing how native "Add to Cart" forms and loop buttons are intercepted and replaced by the zero-dependency slide-out drawer.
- **Explore Shortcode Empty State Guidance**: Enhanced fallback notices in `modules/explore/brands.php`, `modules/explore/categories.php`, and `modules/pharmacy/explore-salts.php` to clarify when terms are hidden due to having no associated products (`hide_empty="true"` by default), advising users to assign products or pass `hide_empty="false"`. Also replaced silent blank outputs in `[swac_categories_grid]` with helpful missing/invalid slug messages.

## [1.3.1] — 05-10-2026

### Fixed
- **Sitemap Activation Hook**: Moved `register_activation_hook()` and `register_deactivation_hook()` from `integrations/sitemap-generator.php` to `stateless-wa-commerce.php` to ensure `/sitemap.xml` rewrite rules flush properly on activation.
- **WooCommerce Native Select2**: Replaced external CDN release-candidate assets (`select2@4.1.0-rc.0`) with WooCommerce core registered `select2` script and style handles in `backend/taxonomy-ui.php`.
- **Taxonomy Save Validation**: Enforced whitelist check against `swac_select2_taxonomies` and `taxonomy_exists()` in `backend/taxonomy-ui.php` prior to updating object terms.
- **Dead Script Defer Filter**: Removed redundant `script_loader_tag` filter in `core/pricing-engine.php` (frontend script deferral is handled natively via WP 6.3+ script loading strategy in `frontend/enqueue.php`).
- **Lockdown Boundary Alignment**:
  - Removed `is_author()` from `cart_checkout_redirect` in `core/catalog-lockdown.php` (already properly handled under `SWAC_DISABLE_BLOG` in `features.php`).
  - Moved `show_admin_bar(false)` from `cart_checkout_redirect` into `SWAC_LOCKDOWN_ADMIN_CLEANUP`.
- **Defensive Function Guards**: Added `if (!function_exists(...))` guards to `swac_price_block_shortcode()`, `swac_pack_size_shortcode()`, `swac_price_pack_hierarchy_shortcode()`, and `swac_action_row_shortcode()` in `frontend/single/product-meta.php`, as well as `swac_register_null_session_handler()` in `core/catalog-lockdown.php`.
- **Markup Consistency**: Removed redundant `wa-*` legacy CSS classes from `frontend/single/delivery-notice.php` in favor of canonical `swac-*` classes.
- **Cart Drawer Disclaimer Fallback**: Removed hardcoded disclaimer fallback in `frontend/components/cart-drawer.php` that was overriding empty or custom disclaimer configurations.
- **Admin Configuration Notice**: Clarified the phone warning notice in `backend/admin-tools.php` to mention `SWAC_PHONE in core/config.php`.
- **WooCommerce Admin Route Intercept**: Added `admin_init` redirect for `admin.php?page=wc-admin` (e.g. `task=products` onboarding and empty-state product links) to redirect seamlessly to the standard WordPress product editor (`post-new.php?post_type=product`) instead of triggering a 403 "Sorry, you are not allowed to access this page" when `admin_cleanup` strips `wc-admin`.

## [1.3.0] — 05-10-2026

### Added
- **Developer Feature Flag Control Panel** (`features.php`):
  - New root-level `features.php` controlling optional WordPress cleanups (`SWAC_DISABLE_BLOG`, `SWAC_DISABLE_BLOCK_EDITOR`), lockdown feature groups, and modular subsystems.
- **Restructured Human-Editable Constant File** (`core/config.php`):
  - Store settings elevated to clean PHP constants with clear boundary above engine code.
- **Prescription Decoupling**: Removed prescription note from core store config to keep general stores clean.
- **Frontend Enqueue Extraction** (`frontend/enqueue.php`): Moved `wp_enqueue_scripts` out of the root plugin file into a dedicated frontend enqueue file.
